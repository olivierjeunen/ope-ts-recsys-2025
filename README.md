# Counterfactual Inference under Thompson Sampling
Source code accompanying our paper "Counterfactual Inference under Thompson Sampling", to appear in RecSys '25.

### Reproducing results

Run the notebooks for a validation using the Open Bandit Pipeline, or a fully synthetic validation for the case of Beta distributions.

## Acknowledgements
